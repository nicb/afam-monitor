# AFAM Monitor

AFAM statistics website (http://statistica.miur.it/scripts/AFAM/vAFAM1.asp) reader and correlation generator

## Description

`AFAM Monitor` is an exercise over `open data` that appear to be *open*, but
are not very significant as sheer numbers. This is to demonstrate the power of
proper ~data correlation~ and to use later on as a more general tool.

As a mere example, we take [a classical dumb statistics website](http://statistica.miur.it/scripts/AFAM/vAFAM1.asp).

## Status

This project is just started. Feel free to contribute.
